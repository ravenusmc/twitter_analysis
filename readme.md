# twitter_analysis
## Intro

This program will use a language sentiment analysis library, TextBlog, to analyze tweets from twitter in a particular subject. I will then take categorize as many tweets as I can from the state that they came from and include the language analysis of the tweet into the state information. 

Thus, a tweet from California that has a sentiment analysis of .54 will be placed into the tweets from CA and those sentiments will then be averaged. I will then hope to graph the data using D3.JS onto a map of the U.S and show how certain tweets will change over time. 

This project is a proof of concept. Its goal is to see if something like this would work and how it would look. As always, I'm up for the challenge!
